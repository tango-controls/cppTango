1. Add Tango::string_free and fix memory leak in zmq_event_subscription_change() (#457,#460)
2. Fix bug impacting device servers using dynamic attributes (#458,#459)

9.3.1
=====

1. Add -pedantic for GCC/Clang and debug mode (#441). This change can generate 
   errors with very old compilers (e.g. gcc 3.4.6) when compiling the lib debug 
   version. Please remove manually -pedantic flag in configure/CMakeLists.txt if
   you need to compile the debug version on a very old compiler.
2. DServerSignal: Include errno header instead of trying to manually get the declaration right (#441)
3. Remove GNU_CXX definition for GCC/Clang (#441)
4. filedatabase.cpp: Remove stray semicolon (#441)
5. FileDatabase: Use correct format specifier for unsigned arguments to sscanf (#441)
6. EventConsumer::connect_event: Fix misleading indentation (#441)
7. PollThread: Fix multiline macro definitions (#451)
8. Generate static library (#17) and fix compilation definitions (#437)
9. Replace asserts in EventConsumer::initialize_received_from_admin with exceptions (#453)

=====

1. Fix FQDN events (#423,#315)
   Limitations:
     - in case DeviceProxy is used for event subscription client will get incorrect value 
	 in the event callback if short domain name is used in env.TANGO_HOST 
	 e.g. hzgc103k -> hzgc103.desy.de
2. Fix memory leak when pipe event is sent and there is no client (#447,#448)
3. Set the ZMQ Receive Buffer High Water Mark only if it changes (#444,#445) 
   to reduce the impact of a bug in ZMQ 4.2.0 and ZMQ 4.2.1.

9.2.8
=====

1. Cmake release targets #438 - Fix appveyor build. 
   Install include files in <install_prefix>/include/tango directory instead of 
   <install_prefix>/include.

9.2.7
=====

1. CPU load when device has large number of attributes #404 
2. push event performance issue #244
3. Fix issue with polling not starting automatically on dynamic attributes #427
4. Tango 9 lts remove zmq hpp #421
5. remove event subscription sleeps on linux #415
6. Fix bug in event name when pushing an error event to IDL5 clients. #400
7. Tango 9 LTS fix#395 (Inserting const C string in DeviceData) #396
