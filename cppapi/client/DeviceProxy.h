 * is a handle to the real Device (hence the name Proxy) and is not the real Device (of course).
 * DeviceProxy provides interfaces to all TANGO devices. The DeviceProxy manages timeouts,
 * stateless connections (new DeviceProxy() nearly always works), and reconnection if the device server is
 * restarted.
